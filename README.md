# Theme Manager Module

Provides a standard way for managing themes and theme configurations.  
Implements an admin UI with a theme selector for the [Admin Module](https://github.com/Platform-OS/pos-module-admin)

## Usage

Once you have the Theme Manager Module installed in your application, it'll provide a standard way for theme modules to register their theme configurations.  
It also provides a `theme_headscripts` partial for your app to render theme-specific scripts and styles in your layout. It renders the necessary theme context from the currently selected theme:  
```
{% include 'modules/theme-manager/theme_headscripts' %}
```
You can select the active theme from the list of available themes on the admin UI at `/admin/themes` 

## Hooks

Implements the `hook_admin_menu`Â hook provided by the admin module to show the "Themes" admin page.  
Implements the `hook_module_info` hook to register itself into the Module registry provided by the [Core Module](https://github.com/Platform-OS/pos-module-core).  
Provides the `hook_theme_configuration` hook for theme modules so they can register their own theme config with the necessary design tokens (colors, sizes, fonts).
